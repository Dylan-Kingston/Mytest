**INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCESSING THE SHELL**

This shell is based off of a Python script, with Linux functionality built into it via a number of internal and external commands.
This Python script works as the default shell of a user that logs into the virtual machine. The user in question does not have access
to the stndard bash shell once the script has been set as their shell.

Firstly, while logged in as a user with root privelages, create a second user:
sudo useradd user2

Various other commands can be run at this time, including setting the new users group, giving it root privelages etc.

Secondly, locate the directory that the Python script is stored in. In my vm, the location is /usr/bin/gitrepo/Mytest.
It is called limitedshell.py.
Run the command to give all users the correct privelages on the script:
sudo chmod a+x limitedshell.py

Thirdly, the script must be set as the shell for the new user you have created:
sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/gitrepo/Mytest/limitedshell.py user2
Notice how the command includes the location of the script, the name of the script, and finally the user that the 
script is being set as the shell of.

To check that the shell has been set correctly, su into the second user.
sudo su - user2

The script should launch automatically. Upon exiting the script when you su into it from root, it should return to root.
If you launched the script by directly logging in to user2, the whole command window will close upon exiting the script.


**INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE SHELL**

The shell/Python script contains a very basic set of available commands. To bring up the list of commands, type 'help' at
the command prompt. This prints the menu of ten or so commands that have been programmed into the script.
